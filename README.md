Assignment 3: Growth, Innovation, Sustainability, and Succession (30%)

Purpose:

In this assignment, students evaluate three growth strategies for a company-owned business, a franchise, and a joint venture. Students will analyze the results of research and determine the strategy that best aligns with an owner’s goals for succession planning, sustainability, and innovation.

Outcomes Met:

· develop critical managerial skills and processes to assess and analyze key elements of emerging enterprise organizations

· evaluate and measure forward-thinking enterprise strategies relevant to sustainability and succession through innovation

Step 1: Review “How to Analyze a Case Study” under Week 2 Content.

Step 2: Create a Word or Rich Text Format (RTF) document that is double-spaced, 12-point font. The final product will be between 2-3pages in length excluding the title page, reference page, and the template (which must be attached to the report as an exhibit);

Step 3: Review the grading rubric for the assignment.

Step 4: Follow this format:

· Title page with title, your name, the course, the instructor’s name;

· Introduction;

· Body, in paragraph form using headings: Use headings for the questions provided but do not include the questions in the paper

· Summary paragraph

Step 5: In writing a case study, the writing is in the third person. What this means is that there are no words such as “I, me, my, we, or us” (first person writing), nor is there use of “you or your” (second person writing).

Step 6: In writing this assignment, students are asked to support the reasoning using in-text citations and a reference list. A reference within a reference list cannot exist without an associated in-text citation and vice versa. View the sample APA paper under Week 2 content

Step 7: Include references from both the class material and from sources other than the class material.

Step 8: In writing this type of assignment, students are expected to paraphrase and not use direct quotes. Learn to paraphrase by reviewing this link: https://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/QPA_paraphrase2.html.

Step 9: Read critically and analyze the scenario provided under Week 8 Content.

Step 10: Write down or highlight key facts from the scenario. Consider making an outline to capture key points in the paper.

Step 11:

Using the fact pattern from the case study located under week 8 content, material from the course and outside research, complete the template at the end of the case study;Once the template is completed, analyze the findings to determine which strategy aligns best with the owner’s goals for succession planning and sustainabilityDiscuss the role of innovation in achieving the owner’s goals;Step 12: Create the introductory paragraph. The introductory paragraph is the first paragraph of the paper but is typically written after writing the body of the paper (Questions students responded to above).
